NAME
       crontab - tables for driving cron

DESCRIPTION
       A  crontab  file  contains  instructions  to the cron(8) daemon of the general form: ``run this command at this time on this date''.  Each user has
       their own crontab, and commands in any given crontab will be executed as the user who owns the crontab.  Uucp and News will usually have their  own
       crontabs, eliminating the need for explicitly running su(1) as part of a cron command.

       Blank lines and leading spaces and tabs are ignored.  Lines whose first non-space character is a hash-sign (#) are comments, and are ignored.  Note
       that comments are not allowed on the same line as cron commands, since they will be taken to be part of the command.  Similarly, comments  are  not
       allowed on the same line as environment variable settings.

       An  active  line in a crontab will be either an environment setting or a cron command.  The crontab file is parsed from top to bottom, so any envi‐
       ronment settings will affect only the cron commands below them in the file.  An environment setting is of the form,

           name = value

       where the spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and any subsequent non-leading spaces in value will be part of the value assigned to name.
       The  value  string  may  be  placed in quotes (single or double, but matching) to preserve leading or trailing blanks. To define an empty variable,
       quotes must be used. The value string is not parsed for environmental substitutions or replacement of variables, thus lines like

           PATH = $HOME/bin:$PATH

       will not work as you might expect. And neither will this work

           A=1
           B=2
           C=$A $B

       There will not be any subsitution for the defined variables in the last value.

       An alternative for setting up the commands path is using the fact that many shells will treat the tilde(~) as substitution of $HOME, so if you  use
       bash for your tasks you can use this:

            SHELL=/bin/bash
            PATH=~/bin:/usr/bin/:/bin

       Several  environment  variables  are  set  up  automatically by the cron(8) daemon.  SHELL is set to /bin/sh, and LOGNAME and HOME are set from the
       /etc/passwd line of the crontab's owner. PATH is set to "/usr/bin:/bin".  HOME, SHELL, and PATH may be overridden by settings in the crontab;  LOG‐
       NAME is the user that the job is running from, and may not be changed.

       (Another note: the LOGNAME variable is sometimes called USER on BSD systems...  on these systems, USER will be set also.)

       In  addition to LOGNAME, HOME, and SHELL, cron(8) will look at MAILTO if it has any reason to send mail as a result of running commands in ``this''
       crontab.  If MAILTO is defined (and non-empty), mail is sent to the user so named.  MAILTO may also be used to direct mail to  multiple  recipients
       by  separating recipient users with a comma. If MAILTO is defined but empty (MAILTO=""), no mail will be sent.  Otherwise mail is sent to the owner
       of the crontab.

       On the Debian GNU/Linux system, cron supports the  pam_env  module,  and  loads  the  environment  specified  by  /etc/environment  and  /etc/secu‐
       rity/pam_env.conf.   It  also  reads locale information from /etc/default/locale.  However, the PAM settings do NOT override the settings described
       above nor any settings in the crontab file itself. Note in particular that if you want a PATH other than "/usr/bin:/bin", you will need to  set  it
       in the crontab file.

       By default, cron will send mail using the mail "Content-Type:" header of "text/plain" with the "charset=" parameter set to the charmap / codeset of
       the locale in which crond(8) is started up - ie. either the default system locale, if no LC_* environment variables are set, or the  locale  speci‐
       fied  by the LC_* environment variables ( see locale(7)).  You can use different character encodings for mailed cron job output by setting the CON‐
       TENT_TYPE and CONTENT_TRANSFER_ENCODING variables in crontabs, to the correct values of the mail headers of those names.

       The format of a cron command is very much the V7 standard, with a number of upward-compatible extensions.  Each line has five time and date fields,
       followed  by  a  command, followed by a newline character ('\n').  The system crontab (/etc/crontab) uses the same format, except that the username
       for the command is specified after the time and date fields and before the command. The fields may be separated by spaces or tabs. The maximum per‐
       mitted length for the command field is 998 characters.

       Commands  are  executed  by  cron(8)  when  the minute, hour, and month of year fields match the current time, and when at least one of the two day
       fields (day of month, or day of week) match the current time (see ``Note'' below).  cron(8) examines cron entries once every minute.  The time  and
       date fields are:

              field          allowed values
              -----          --------------
              minute         0-59
              hour           0-23
              day of month   1-31
              month          1-12 (or names, see below)
              day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)

       A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for ``first-last''.

       Ranges  of  numbers  are  allowed.   Ranges  are  two numbers separated with a hyphen.  The specified range is inclusive.  For example, 8-11 for an
       ``hours'' entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.

       Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by commas.  Examples: ``1,2,5,9'', ``0-4,8-12''.

       Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Following a range with ``/<number>'' specifies skips of the number's value through the  range.
       For  example,  ``0-23/2''  can  be  used  in  the  hours field to specify command execution every other hour (the alternative in the V7 standard is
       ``0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22'').  Steps are also permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say ``every two hours'', just use ``*/2''.

       Names can also be used for the ``month'' and ``day of week'' fields.  Use the first three letters of the particular day or month (case doesn't mat‐
       ter).  Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.

       The  ``sixth''  field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to be run.  The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or % charac‐
       ter, will be executed by /bin/sh or by the shell specified in the SHELL variable of the crontab file.  Percent-signs (%)  in  the  command,  unless
       escaped  with backslash (\), will be changed into newline characters, and all data after the first % will be sent to the command as standard input.
       There is no way to split a single command line onto multiple lines, like the shell's trailing "\".

       Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two fields — day of month, and day of week.  If both fields are restricted (i.e., aren't
       *), the command will be run when either field matches the current time.  For example,
       ``30  4  1,15  * 5'' would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday. One can, however, achieve the
       desired result by adding a test to the command (see the last example in EXAMPLE CRON FILE below).

       Instead of the first five fields, one of eight special strings may appear:

              string         meaning
              ------         -------
              @reboot        Run once, at startup.
              @yearly        Run once a year, "0 0 1 1 *".
              @annually      (same as @yearly)
              @monthly       Run once a month, "0 0 1 * *".
              @weekly        Run once a week, "0 0 * * 0".
              @daily         Run once a day, "0 0 * * *".
              @midnight      (same as @daily)
              @hourly        Run once an hour, "0 * * * *".

       Please note that startup, as far as @reboot is concerned, is the time when the cron(8) daemon startup.  In particular, it may be before some system
       daemons, or other facilities, were startup.  This is due to the boot order sequence of the machine.

EXAMPLE CRON FILE
       The following lists an example of a user crontab file.

       # use /bin/bash to run commands, instead of the default /bin/sh
       SHELL=/bin/bash
       # mail any output to `paul', no matter whose crontab this is
       MAILTO=paul
       #
       # run five minutes after midnight, every day
       5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/daily.job >> $HOME/tmp/out 2>&1
       # run at 2:15pm on the first of every month -- output mailed to paul
       15 14 1 * *     $HOME/bin/monthly
       # run at 10 pm on weekdays, annoy Joe
       0 22 * * 1-5    mail -s "It's 10pm" joe%Joe,%%Where are your kids?%
       23 0-23/2 * * * echo "run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday"
       5 4 * * sun     echo "run at 5 after 4 every sunday"
       # Run on every second Saturday of the month
       0 4 8-14 * *    test $(date +\%u) -eq 6 && echo "2nd Saturday"

EXAMPLE SYSTEM CRON FILE
       The  following  lists  the  content  of  a regular system-wide crontab file. Unlinke a user's crontab, this file has the username field, as used by
       /etc/crontab.

       # /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
       # Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
       # command to install the new version when you edit this file
       # and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
       # that none of the other crontabs do.

       SHELL=/bin/sh
       PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

       # m h dom mon dow usercommand
       17 * * * *  root  cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
       25 6 * * *  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
       47 6 * * 7  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
       52 6 1 * *  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
       #

EXTENSIONS
       When specifying day of week, both day 0 and day 7 will be considered Sunday.  BSD and AT&T seem to disagree about this.

       Lists and ranges are allowed to co-exist in the same field.  "1-3,7-9" would be rejected by AT&T or BSD cron -- they want to see "1-3"  or  "7,8,9"
       ONLY.

       Ranges can include "steps", so "1-9/2" is the same as "1,3,5,7,9".

       Months or days of the week can be specified by name.

       Environment variables can be set in the crontab.  In BSD or AT&T, the environment handed to child processes is basically the one from /etc/rc.

       Command  output is mailed to the crontab owner (BSD can't do this), can be mailed to a person other than the crontab owner (SysV can't do this), or
       the feature can be turned off and no mail will be sent at all (SysV can't do this either).

       All of the `@' commands that can appear in place of the first five fields are extensions.

LIMITATIONS
       The cron daemon runs with a defined timezone. It currently does not support per-user timezones. All the tasks: system's  and  user's  will  be  run
       based  on  the configured timezone. Even if a user specifies the TZ environment variable in his crontab this will affect only the commands executed
       in the crontab, not the execution of the crontab tasks themselves.

       The crontab syntax does not make it possible to define all possible periods one could image off. For example, it is not straightforward  to  define
       the last weekday of a month. If a task needs to be run in a specific period of time that cannot be defined in the crontab syntaxs the best approach
       would be to have the program itself check the date and time information and continue execution only if the period matches the desired one.

       If the program itself cannot do the checks then a wrapper script would be required. Useful tools that could be used for date analysis are  ncal  or
       calendar For example, to run a program the last Saturday of every month you could use the following wrapper code:

       0 4 * * Sat   [ "$(date +\%e)" = "`ncal | grep $(date +\%a | sed -e 's/.$//') | sed -e 's/^.*\s\([0-9]\+\)\s*$/\1/'`" ] && echo "Last Saturday" && program_to_run

DIAGNOSTICS
       cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character. If the last entry in a crontab is missing a newline (ie, terminated by EOF),
       cron will consider the crontab (at least partially) broken. A warning will be written to syslog.
